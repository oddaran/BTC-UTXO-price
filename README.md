Hola compas,

I'm Daran, I've been residing for the last 9 years in Denver, CO from Orlando, FL.  Before Florida I was living in Columbus OH.  My background relates to pharmacy and ophthalmology, where I had worked 10 years in healthcare (retail and ambulatory) care settings.  I've always like to grab information to make big assessments on whether an outcome will happen.  Plus I envisioned for myself a career where I'd be able to stay mobile efficient.  I also wanted to manage/create/enhance/sustain all the healthcare data that is so unstructured in silos.  Upon researching for a career in applying mathematics and analytics, it brought me to seek the MSDA. 

The knowledge and skills that would be great to have are many, but I think its important to be able to use math directly in business operations, not just for decision support but to make real-time decisions.  It's also good to attain a number of modeling techniques, ie linear-regression or Bayesian modelling, which contain their own set of philosophies you agree with per its usage/application.  Last I think it's fundamental to have an unassuming inquisitiveness that will make the scientist motivated to ask questions about the technical assumptions of models before they are applied.
